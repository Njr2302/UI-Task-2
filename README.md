# UI-Task-2
## Objective: Create a responsive project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Bootstrap (or any supporting jQuery libraries).

## Requirements:
## 1.Responsive Navigation Menu

    ->Implement a navigation menu that displays as a horizontal bar on desktop and transforms into a vertical dropdown on mobile.
  
    ->Include smooth animations for opening and closing.
  
    ->Focus on accessibility, touch-friendly targets, and transitions.

## 2.Card Layout

    ->Build a responsive grid of cards with images and text.
  
    ->On large screens: show 4â€“6 cards per row.
  
    ->On medium screens: show 2â€“3 cards per row.
  
    ->On small screens: show 1 card per row.

Ensure images maintain aspect ratio and text remains legible.

## 3.Responsive Typography

    ->Apply a typography strategy that scales fonts and line heights according to the viewport.
  
    ->Use fluid units like vw, em, rem.
  
    ->Maintain readability and proper hierarchy across devices.

## 4.CSS Media Queries

    ->Write media queries to adapt the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
  
    ->Keep the overall look consistent across breakpoints.
  
    ->Be ready to explain the trade-offs between fixed breakpoints vs. fluid layouts.
